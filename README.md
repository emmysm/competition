# Competitions

### Welcome to the bitDubai software competitions!

Every year we organize software competitions in order to promote the Fermat project. We started in 2015 by selecting the core development team from among the best JAVA programmers that signed up. We spent a great summer in Budapest programming the core of Fermat. 

For 2016 we also have many fun stuff on the pipeline! We have already launched a 10 months competition that will let you tap into blockchain technology, measure your skills in JAVA and take you to Dubai!

Check out the link below to know more about this exciting competition!
